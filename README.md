##  Solution Explanation & Trade-offs

This Contact Manager app uses `fetch()` on the frontend to communicate with a Node.js backend. The backend stores contact data in a local JSON file using **LowDB**.

The UI is split into reusable components like:

- `ContactList`
- `AddContactForm`

### ‚öñÔ∏è Trade-offs and Decisions

1.  Used `lowdb` for quick setup.
2.  Focused on core functionality over complex styling to keep the UI simple and understandable.
3.  Skipped test cases due to time limits.
5. Handled many edge cases in UI and deletion flows.
